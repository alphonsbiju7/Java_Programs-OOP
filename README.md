# Java Programs – OOP & Core Java Practice

This repository contains a well-organized collection of Java programs developed by **Alphons Biju** as part of the **3rd Semester BTech Computer Science (OOP Course)** at  
**St Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Palai**.

The programs cover **core Java fundamentals**, **object-oriented programming**, **file handling**, **exception handling**, **vectors**, and various logical and algorithmic problems.  
All programs are structured in clean folder modules for easy learning and revision.

## 🚀 How to Run (VS Code / Terminal)

### Compile a program:
```bash
javac FileName.java
````

### Run the program:

```bash
java FileName
```

For programs inside folders:

```bash
cd 01_Basics
javac oddPrint.java
java oddPrint
```

If you want, I can also:

✔ Add **badges** (Java version, GitHub stars, last updated)  
✔ Add **screenshots** of VS Code  
✔ Add a **banner/logo** for your repo  
✔ Add **program list table** with links  

Just say **“Add badges”** or **“Add banner”** or **“Add table”**.
```
